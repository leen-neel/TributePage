				Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 â€“ June 25, 2009) was an American
				singer, songwriter and dancer. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded
				as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century.
				Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance and
				fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global
				figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music
				genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated
				dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as
				the robot. He is the most awarded music artist in history.
